Rules of interface:

Rule 1: - By default all the member methods of an interface are "abstract".

Rule 2: - A child class has to implements(not override) all the methods of an interface.
		  (word "implements" is used rather than override because child class is just implementing
		  the standards define by interface, not extending its functionality.
		  
Rule 3: - While giving the body of a member method of interface (in child class make it public).
		  (just because its execution is handled by interface itself i.e it is being called from outside the class)
		  (Only public, static, abstract,default,strictfp are permitted.)
		  
Rule 4: - By default all the methods of an interface are "public".

Rule 5: - One class can implements more than one interface simultanously.
